-- but you can call me Zaan as well.

I am a PhD student in Theoretical Physics at the University of Sussex. I work with Quantum Field Theory and I am mainly interested in the Renormalization Group.

Before starting my PhD at Sussex, I obtained an MSc degree in *Theoretical Physics* from the University of Edinburgh. Prior to that, I obtained a BSc degree in *Physics with Theoretical Physics* from King's College London.

I grew up in the Maldives, a small archipelago in the middle of the Indian Ocean known mainly for tourism.
