# My name is Zaan.

I am a postgraduate student in theoretical physics. My main interests are primarily in *Quantum Field Theory* (QFT). Problems in particle physics, quantum gravity and cosmology are what I like to think about.

Most recently, I obtained an MSc degree in *Theoretical Physics* from the University of Edinburgh. Prior to that, I obtained a BSc degree in *Physics with Theoretical Physics* from King's College London.
