# My name is Zaan.
I am a postgraduate student in theoretical physics. My main interests are primarily in between *Quantum Field Theory* (which describes particles as excitations of a 'quantum field') and *General Relativity* (which is the theory of gravity). To be a little more specific, I'm most interested in the physics of inflation, black holes, etc.

Most recently, I was awarded an MSc degree in *Theoretical Physics* from the University of Edinburgh. Prior to that, I was awarded a BSc degree in *Physics with Theoretical Physics* from King's College London.
