### My name is Zaan.
I'm a postgraduate student in theoretical physics. My main interests are primarily in between *Quantum Field Theory* (which describes particles as excitations of a 'quantum field') and *General Relativity* (which is a theory of gravity).

Most recently, I completed an MSc in *Theoretical Physics* at the University of Edinburgh. Prior to that, I obtained a BSc in *Physics with Theoretical Physics* from King's College London.
