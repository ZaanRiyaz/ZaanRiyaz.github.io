# My name is Zaan.
I'm a postgraduate student in theoretical physics. My main interests are primarily in between *Quantum Field Theory* (which describes particles as excitations of a 'quantum field') and *General Relativity* (which is a theory of gravity).

Most recently, I was awarded an MSc degree in *Theoretical Physics* at the University of Edinburgh. Prior to that, I was awarded a BSc degree in *Physics with Theoretical Physics* from King's College London.
