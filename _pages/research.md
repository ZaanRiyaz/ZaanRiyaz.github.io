I currently work on fixed points in particle physics. The framework we use to study this is called the `renormalisation group' in QFT. This has to do with the notion that the coupling constants are a function of the energy scale at which we consider the theory. The way these couplings run with energy is given to us by beta functions;


$$
\beta_{g} = \frac{dg(\mu)}{d\ln\mu}
$$

Interesting things happen when these beta functions are zero, that is when the couplings stop running with respect to energy. By finding the zeroes of the beta function, we get fixed points.

$$
\beta_{g} = 0 \Longrightarrow g(\mu)^{\ast}
$$

At a fixed point, we can use the tools of CFT to describe the physics because the theory is conformally invariant. The most well known example of a fixed point in a QFT is the UV free fixed point in QCD, $g^{\ast} = 0$. This means that at high energies, QCD becomes a free theory (with no interactions). This is called `asymptotic freedom'.
