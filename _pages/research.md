My main focus is the [Renormalization Group](#renormalization-group-rg) in [Quantum Field Theory](#quantum-field-theory-qft).

## Quantum Field Theory (QFT)
In essence, this is the theory used to study particles (electrons, quarks etc.) and their interactions. For instance, we can use QFT to make predictions for quantities like the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron which can then measured and compared to experiment.

## Renormalization Group (RG)
This is a framework within QFT used to study the subtleties involved in the physics at different scales.
