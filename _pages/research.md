I mainly work with fixed points in theories of particle physics in and beyond the standard model.

>In QFT, the *beta fuction* tells us how the coupling constants of a theory change with the energy scale $\mu$. The zeroes of the beta function corresponds to *fixed points*. The most generic kind of fixed point we can have is a non-interacting fixed point which corresponds to $$\alpha^{\ast}(\mu) = 0$$. Here, the theory is `free' (eg; asymptotic freedom in QCD where the coupling vanishes in the UV). There is also the possibility for fixed points to be interacting, where $$\alpha^{\ast}(\mu)\neq 0$$.
